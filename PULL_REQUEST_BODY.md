Title: tests(login): add validation tests + global setup for storage state

## Summary
Add comprehensive UI login validation tests and a global setup that generates an authenticated `storageState` to improve test stability and performance.

## Changes
- Added `tests/ui/auth/login.validation.spec.ts` — login success and failure cases (incorrect password, unknown email, disabled account optional).
- Added `tests/ui/open-localhost.screenshot.spec.ts` — simple test to capture a screenshot of localhost.
- Modified `src/pages/LoginPage.ts` — exposes `formErrors` and `getFirstVisibleErrorText()` to assert UI error messages.
- Modified `tests/ui/auth/login-logout.spec.ts` — avoid Cloudflare checks on localhost.
- Added `scripts/global-setup.ts` — performs an authenticated login and writes `storage/customer.storageState.json`.
- Updated `playwright.config.ts` to reference `globalSetup` and centralize storage usage.
- Added `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Motivation and Context
- Improves test reliability by asserting server responses and visible error messages instead of relying solely on redirects.
- Speeds up UI test runs by reusing authenticated storage state generated in `globalSetup` (useful for CI).
- Prepares the framework for easier expansion (fixtures, POM improvements, CI artifact collection).

## How to Test
1. Provide credentials in environment or `.env`:
   - `E2E_USER_EMAIL` and `E2E_USER_PASSWORD` (required for storage generation)
   - Optional: `DISABLED_USER_EMAIL` and `DISABLED_USER_PASSWORD` (for disabled-account test)
2. To generate storage state locally: `npx playwright test --project=setup` (or run the branch's `globalSetup` runs automatically when `USE_STORAGE_STATE=true`).
3. Run UI tests: `USE_STORAGE_STATE=true npx playwright test --project=ui` or `npx playwright test tests/ui/auth/login.validation.spec.ts --project=ui`.

## Checklist
- [ ] Code compiles and TypeScript checks pass
- [ ] Playwright tests run locally with provided env vars
- [ ] No secrets or sensitive data committed
- [ ] Add CI job to run `api` and `ui` projects and upload artifacts

## Related PRs / Notes
- Consider adding a GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and upload artifacts (JUnit/HTML) and to store secrets in Actions secrets.
